# Contributing to BuddyBot

Thank you for considering contributing to BuddyBot.

First up, I'd like you to know that whilst code is always welcom, we encourage all forms of contribution; docs, issues, discussions, and suggestions. If you would like to take part, read on. This guide should help you get started.

There is no correct way to develop or to participate in a project and contributions will still be considered if this guide is ignored. However, following these guidelines helps to communicate that you respect the time of the developers managing and developing BuddyBot. In return, you can expect them to reciprocate that respect in addressing your issue, assessing changes, and helping you make a contribution.

Please don't raise issues for questions or general discussion. We are active members of the CodeBuddies Slack and the best place to ask questions is in the [#personal-projects](https://codebuddies.slack.com/messages/personal-projects/) channel. If you aren't a member of CodeBuddies Slack, you can join here: [codebuddies.org](https://codebuddies.org).

# Ground Rules

We expect all contributors to read and abide by our Code of Conduct. This Code of Conduct is adapted from the [Contributor Covenant](contributor-covenant.org), version 1.4,
available at [contributor-covenant.org](https://www.contributor-covenant.org/version/1/4/code-of-conduct.html).

# Your first contribution

If you want to contribute but are unsure where to begin, you can start by looking through these `good first issue` and `help wanted` issues:

* [good first issue](https://github.com/billglover/buddybot/issues?q=is%3Aopen+is%3Aissue+sort%3Acomments-desc+label%3A%22good+first+issue%22) - issues which should only require a few lines of code, and a test or two.
* [help wanted](https://github.com/billglover/buddybot/issues?q=is%3Aopen+is%3Aissue+sort%3Acomments-desc+label%3A%22help+wanted%22) - issues which should be a bit more involved than beginner issues.

Both issue lists are sorted by total number of comments. While not perfect, number of comments is a reasonable proxy for impact a given change will have.

If this is your first contribution and you'd like some additional help, there are some excelent resources available on [firsttimersonly.com](https://www.firsttimersonly.com).

Finally, if you'd like a little extra help, please leave a comment on the issue you'd like to tackle and I'll do my best to walk you throught the process of making your first contribution.

# Getting started

1. Leave a comment on an issue to let us know you are working on it.
2. Fork the repo and create a branch from master.
3. Commit changes to your branch.
4. If you've added code that should be tested, add tests.
5. Run `gofmt` to format your code.
6. Ensure the test suite passes.
5. Issue that pull request!

At this point we'll be notified that your changes are ready. We'll then review the code and work with you to get the changes merged. More on this can be found in the section on the [Code review process](#code-review-process).

# How to report a bug

If you find a security vulnerability or a vulnerability that has the potential to disclose personal data, plesae do NOT open an issue. Email bill@billglover.co.uk instead.

To report a bug, create a new issue on GitHub. The issue will be pre-populated with a template that should help you fill out the required information.

# How to suggest a feature or enhancement

To request a feature, create a new issue on GitHub. The issue will be pre-populated with a template that should help you fill out the required information.

Note, not all feature requests will be implemented but we will involve you in any discussion around the feature you request.

# Code review process

We review all pull requests and as part of this review process we may request changes to your submission. We will always explain why these changes are being requested.

Although changes may be small, we typically leave pull requests open for a couple of days to allow for others to comment. This is normal and your change is not being ignored. While you are waiting, feel free to review any open pull requests.

Occasionally a pull request will not be merged but if you've followed this guide it is highly unlikely this will happen. We will always explain if this is the case.

# Community

We can be found on the CodeBuddies forum or Slack. Visit [codebuddies.org](https://codebuddies.org) to find out more.
